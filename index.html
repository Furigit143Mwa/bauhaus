            <p>Bauhaus was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught.</p> <br>
            <p>It operated in Germany from 1919 to 1933, when the Nazis closed it down. The faculty brought together artists, architects, and designers, and developed an experimental pedagogy that focused on materials and functions rather than traditional art-school methodologies.</p>
